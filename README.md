# Web Studio - HTML Form Elements and Styling

Welcome to the next phase of the Web Studio project! This part of the project includes the integration of HTML form components with  styles, enhancing the user experience when interacting with forms on the web pages. The following provides a breakdown of the contents within this project segment.

## Project Contents

### HTML Form Elements

- All styles for the project are consolidated in a single CSS file named `styles.css`, located in the `css` folder.
- The CSS code is formatted using Prettier, ensuring consistent and readable code.
- All images and textual content are accurately placed within the layout as per the original design.
- The project utilizes the [`modern-normalize`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) stylesheet to ensure a consistent rendering across different browsers.
- The HTML code follows the guidelines provided in the [tutorial](https://codeguide.co/).

### Form Elements

- All elements in the layout are marked up using appropriate HTML tags.
- Semantic HTML tags are used in accordance with their intended meanings.
- Form elements for the newsletter signup, including input fields, have been added to the footer.
- Form elements for the application form, including input fields, have been added to the modal window.
- All input fields in the forms have the required `name` attribute.
- The `name` attribute values are descriptive, accurately describing the purpose of each form field.
- All input fields in the forms are associated with a corresponding `<label>` element.
- The `placeholder` attribute is set for input fields where it serves as a hint for the expected input format.
- Form submission buttons have the `type="submit"` attribute set.

### Styling

- The styling for the newsletter signup form in the footer is completed, ensuring it aligns with the overall design.
- The styling for the application form in the modal window is finalized, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- When a form field receives focus, both its border and icon change color, as demonstrated in the design.
- The original checkbox for accepting the terms and policies in the application form is hidden by default, meaning it is not automatically checked.
- The styling for the "checkbox" of the license agreement acceptance is manually created using a vector image of a checkmark from the SVG sprite.
- Transitions are applied to all hover and focus effects, with a duration of 250ms and a cubic-bezier timing function (cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)).

## Conclusion

This part of the Web Studio project introduces functional and stylish forms, enhancing user interaction and capturing important data. The consistent use of semantic HTML tags and carefully structured forms ensures a positive user experience. The thoughtful styling, including transitions and custom checkbox elements, adds a touch of sophistication to the project.
